pyGMing
=======

A collection of python scripts to help an table top role playing game master. 

What is this?
=======
pyGMing is a collection of scripts I write for my role playing campaigns. Even though I intend to bumdle the script into one program, for now they all operate on a stand alone basis. 

Why should I use this?
=======
The scrits are written with two things in mind, stochasticity, and ease of game. Currently things are written so there is a "pool" of sources (monster, coins, potions, etc.) and whenever there is an encounter, the generator draw on those source pools. If you don't like this idea, you shouldn't use these scripts. 

When should I use this?
=======
During the session, when you wish to create a random encounter. 

How do I install and use this?
=======
First of, install python
For now, download the script into a new folder, and then run 

``python <script name>.py``

I'll change the name of the files soon, and will create propper installer one day...
