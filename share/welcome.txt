<html><h1>Welcome</h1>
Welcome to pyGM. Not much is done yet. At the bottom, you can see the command
line, which you'll use to interaction with. Above to it, is the condition
marker. To the right, at the top, you can find the (empty) initiative order.
Once you'll add a creature to it, it will have the format of <i><tt>i.name(HP)</tt></i>
with <i>i</i> marking the initiative order, <i>name</i> the creature name, and
<i>hp</i> the hp of that creature. For example

<p><tt>5.goblin(13)</tt>,</p>

notes a goblin with 13 hp that has an initiative score of 5.
<p>
Command index will be available later, for now, type <b>add</b> to add an
creature to the initiative order, and <b>step</b> to advance in initiative.
Typing help following command name will give more information.
